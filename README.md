too-many-questions
==================

TThis project may help you answer to some questions about your address book... Ok, actually this 

project is my humble solution to the Gumtree AddressBook Coding Challenge.
<br><br>
The tools I used are Eclipse Kepler SR 2 (with Java 8 Suppurt Package), Maven and Git (of course).
The libraries are Spring, OpenCSV and Junit (with Hamcrest) for the tests.
<br><br>
The project consists of a DDD inspired domain and some unit and functional tests. For the time 

being the only client code that uses the domain to answer the Gumtree questions is the functional 

tests code. Other client code (e.g. human interface or restful service provider code) should act 

exactly as the code in functional tests.  
<br><br>
The process I used to develop this project is TDD, inspired by XP principles ("The simplest thing 

that could possibly work" in particular :) 
<br><br>
P.S. I enjoyed this pet project, because I had the opportunity to learn and use some new tools and libraries that I read about but never had the chance to use before.
